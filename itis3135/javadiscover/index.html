        <h2>Project Proposal - Java Discover - Client Outside of Class</h2>
	</header>
	
	<main>
		<h3>Project Category/Overview: </h3>
		<p>
			In my project I am designing a website to teach my client some of the basics of Java in hopes to develop more 
			interest in programming. This project will be somewhat interactive with some activities on it to test the 
			users knowledge after completing the reading. The website will primarily include html css and javascript 
			elements with jquery also being a possibilty on top of ajax functionality. The intended users for this site
			are people who are looking to get into programming or people who want to further develop their programming 
			knoweldge but need somewhere to start for java. The website will include multiple pages that are marked 
			as stages in a students learning so there is a sense of progression. 
        </p>

		<h3>Client Information: </h3>
		<ul id = "listelements">
			<li><strong>Name:</strong> Matthew Abel </li>
			<li><strong>Organization:</strong> Cisco (Employee)</li>
			<li><strong>Email:</strong> [private] </li>
			<li><strong>Phone Number:</strong> [private] </li>

			<figcaption>The wireframe format for the website without any css styling</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Each of the pages will have an interactive UI that is enabled by both Javascript and JQuery elements in order to 
			maximize interaction from the students and keep them engaged. AJax functionality will also be included so the 
			user doesn't have to refresh and everything should automatically update and flow nicely.

		<h3>Page Design: </h3>
		<ul id = "listelements">
			<li><strong>Page 1[Home]:</strong> The purpose of this page is to welcome new users and students as well as provide 
						an overview of everything they will be learning. No data will be requested on this page so no validation 
						or verification is required. The page will contain a single button that takes them to stage one where 
						they can begin learning about java.</li>
			<br>
			<li><strong>Page 2[Stage 1]:</strong> The purpose of this page is to walk the student through a 'Hello World' assignment
						where the student will learn about the significance of semi-colon as well as learn how to print statements.
						The page will include a walk-through of 'Hello World' as well as an assignment for the user to do to apply 
						their knowledge. Data will be requested of the user to answer basic questions that could require validation
						but it will mostly serve as a mehtod to answer questions. The page could contain buttons or dropdowns to ask
						the user questions where they can easily respond.</li>
			<br>
			<li><strong>Page 3[Stage 2]:</strong> The purpose of this page is to inform the user about the primitive data types
						in java as well as basic number manipulation through addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
						The page will include a description of every data type as well as an assignment for the user to do to apply 
						their knowledge. Data will be requested of the user to answer basic questions that could require validation
						but it will mostly serve as a mehtod to answer questions. The page could contain buttons or dropdowns to ask
						the user questions where they can easily respond.</li>
			<br>
			<li><strong>Page 4[Stage 3]:</strong> The purpose of this page is to introduce the concept of loops to the student as 
						well as show them different types and their applications. This page will show examples and provide descriptions
						for every significant loop as well as provide an assignment for the user to do to apply their knowledge. Data 
						will be requested of the user to answer basic questions that could require validation but it will mostly serve 
						as a mehtod to answer questions. The page could contain buttons or dropdowns to ask the user questions where they 
						can easily respond.</li>
			<br>
			<li><strong>Page 5[Stage 4]:</strong> The purpose of this page is provide an introduction to methods to the user where they
						will learn how to apply methods in their code to increase efficiency and write better looking code.
						The page will include a walk-through of method creation where they will eventually be given an assignment to 
						work on to test their knowledge. Data will be requested of the user to answer basic questions that could require validation
						but it will mostly serve as a mehtod to answer questions. The page could contain buttons or dropdowns to ask
						the user questions where they can easily respond.</li>
			<br>
			<li><strong>Page 6[Stage 5]:</strong> The purpose of this page is to provide a surface level understanding of object oriented
						programming where the will learn how to create a constructor, getter, and setter for the creation of objects.
						The page will include a descriptions and examples of object creation as well as display how they can be implemented. 
						An activity will be provided in order to test the students knowledge, requesting them to create class with a getter, setter
						and constructor. Data will be requested of the user to answer basic questions that could require validation
						but it will mostly serve as a mehtod to answer questions. The page could contain buttons or dropdowns to ask
						the user questions where they can easily respond.</li>
		</ul>
		<hr class = "solid">
		<h3>Dynamic Functionality: </h3>
		<p>
			The dynamic functionality of each of the pages remains quite simple, with most of them including buttons to ask questions and 
			interact wiht the user. For the most part, the interactivity between the user and the website is limited to questions being 
			asked by the webiste and the user provides and answer where the site validates if it is correct.
