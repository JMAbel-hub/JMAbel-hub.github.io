			<h2>Overview: </h2>
			<p>
				For this assignment I've decided to make a page where I review some of my current favorite video games where
				each section represents a different game review with a total of 6 sections allowing 5 game reviews total
				on the page. Each review will include two paragraphs where I will describe the game in detail as well as 
				include my thoughts and opinions which should justify my time spent with the game as well as my rating. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I've decided to include some recent games as well as some of my all time favorites in this collection to
				cover a wider variety of games so you can hopefully find something that peaks your interest. The games 
				I've decided to review are as follows: Elden Ring, League of Legends, Overwatch, Counter Strike: Global
				Offensive, and Cuphead. All of these games I can say I have thoroughly enjoyed and most likely still
				play occasionally.

			<h2>Elden Ring: </h2>
			<p>
				The most recent game released on this list, Elden Ring is a third person action role-playing game developed
				by FromSoftware Inc. The game has a heavy focus on combat and exploration where the player takes the role 
				of a lowly tarnished adventuring in pursuit of becoming the coveted Elden Lord. This game is very unique 
				in that it does not lock any content behind any walls and the entire world can be explored without 
				progressing the story allowing curiousity to reign supreme. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At the time of this writing, I have yet to complete the entire game, however I've played enough to with 
				out a doubt, reccomend this game to anyone. The game lets you approach it at your own rate and everything
				in it feels completely unique aided by the beautiful environments. For more casual players the game might
				be a little too difficult, however the combat and exploratory aspects make this game simply impossible 
				to pass up on. My only gripe with this game is that some assets are reused a little too much, with some 
				bosses reoccuring a little too often later in the game.

		<section id="league_of_legends">
			<h2>League of Legends: </h2>
			<p>
				By far the most popular game on this list, League of Legends is a mulitplayer online battle arena video game
				that was developed by Riot Games. The game purely serves as a competitive multiplayer game where 10 players
				are put against eachother in a 5v5 format where they compete to see which side functions better as a team
				and generally outplay their opponents. The unique part of this game is the 140 and counting playble characters 
				(commonly known as champions) all with 5 unique abilities and passives for them to use against their opponents.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although I have by far the most hours in this game out of any of the games I've played, it is very difficult
				to actully reccomend this game. It is an incredibly difficult game to understand to the point where I would 
				say that it would take a year of consistently playing to actually comprehend most of the things in the game 
				to an satisfactory level. I've been playing the game for upwards of 10 years and I'm still learning new 
				things in the game. The game is everchanging, so there is always a new strategy to the game which keeps the 
				game interesting, but also makes it incredibly difficult to grasp for newer players.

			<h2>Overwatch: </h2>
			<p>
				Overwatch is a class-based online mulitplayer shooter that puts 12 players in a 6v6 game where they 
				compete to complete an objective. In this scenario one side plays attack and the other plays 
				defense where the attackers are actively trying to complete an objects while the defenders are 
				trying to stop them. Each team is able to select characters to play from a roster of 32 playable
				characters (known as heros) with unique abilities as well as an assigned role (tank, damage, support) 
				which a team can only have up to 2 of making a team of 6. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After playing this game extensively this game is pretty easy to reccomend to anyone interested in 
				shooter games. Overwatch has a very high emphasis on teamwork with it being required to play it 
				at its highest level, however it is not necessary enough to warrant any complaints. The game is 
				very flexible in that it can be as casual or as competitive as the player wants with plenty of 
				fun gamemodes and new things to try as well as a ranked gamemode to test a players skill.

		<section id="counter_strike">
			<h2>Counter Strike: Global Offesnive: </h2>
			<p>
				Counter-Strike is an objective-based, multiplayer first-person shooter. Two opposing teams of 5: the Terrorists 
				and the Counter Terrorists compete in game modes to complete objectives, such as securing a location to plant 
				or defuse a bomb and rescuing or guarding hostages where players play rounds in a best of 30 format. After each 
				round played in the game, the player is given money depending on how their team did and if they completed any objective
				where they can then participate in the unique part of this game, the economy system. Each player has to allocate their 
				money in order to buy guns, armor, and grenades which varies depending on strategy. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This game is another case of a game that is good depending on how much time you put into it. More specifically, if 
				you have time to dump into learning the many strategies and mastering the economy, this game is absolutely incredible
				with insane depth. However, if you don't have that time then I woudln't exactly reccomend it since there are so many 
				complex moving parts within the game that take a lot of time to grasp. Since the game is a bit older, I can't really
				reccomned this game since the playerbase is somewhat dwindling, however, since it's free you can go ahead and try it 
				if it sounds like something that would interest you.

		<section id="cuphead">
			<h2>Cuphead: </h2>
			<p>
				Definitely the most unique game on this list, Cuphead is a extremely stylized run-and-gun video game 
				developed by Studio MDHR. The game is deceptively difficult with a very simple combat system, with 
				unique bosses in vainn of the Contra video game series. This game is extremely unqiue with everything
				being hand drawn and animated in an old timey, rubber hose style that makes the game almost immediately
				recognizable. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This game is another extremely easy reccomend from me due to its highly addictive gameplay and extremely
				charming art style, this game is a masterpiece. The only thing that bumps it down from being a perfect 
				game is that some of the bosses may be a little too difficult for a more casual audience, however to me 
				the art style and gameplay make the game far too enjoyable to pass up on.
