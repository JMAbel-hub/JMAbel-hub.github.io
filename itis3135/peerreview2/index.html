		<h3>File Management/Naming: </h3>
		<p>
			File management looks great on this page with no spaces contained within the files and folder
			names and all of the files being allocated to dedicated folders correctly such as css files
			in a styles folder. The html pages are found in the root of the folder of the project and 
			other files are exactly where they need to be. The primary stylesheet is found within the 
			the styles folder however it is under a slightly different name of project_default.css 
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Styles: </h3>
		<p>
			The page has somes styles applied with very minimal color and text alterations with the primary
			color being green on a white background with black text. The default style sheet has a slightly
			different name of project_default.css with a semi-neat format with the only issue being inconsistent curly 
			braces creating a little confusion when attempting to read it. Other than that, the spacing/styling 
			seems consistent throughout the entire file so there's no issue there.
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Page Design: </h3>
		<p>
			This project doesn't contain any of the blacklisted fonts with the only styling issue being black text 
			on a white background which isn't that big of an issue if you surround it with other interesting elements.
			Links are correctly changed according to the set themes, opting for a different color style whilst keeping
			the outline. Each page contains a title that correctly informs the user what page they're on with it also
			being included in every complete heading. This being said there is no defining features on the sight 
			informing the user what site they are on such as a logo or graphic. The footer does contain a designer 
			tag as well as sucesfully including the validation buttons. There is very little to go off of in terms
			of CRAP desgin elements, however, the only issue I've seen is contrast being a little strange since
			the color palette seems incomplete. 
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Validation: </h3>
		<p>
			The validation buttons are the ones we have been given in the course, meaning they're an image that links
			to the validator. This being said, it could use some styling to make it fit in better to the website and 
			the html validates fine, however the css has some errors. 
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Page Code:</h3>
		<p>
			The page code is a bit strange with the header and footer being stored in a seperate file under a div tag.
			From what I can tell there is no explictly stated header and footer found within the webpages which could 
			create a little confusion. From what I've seen the indents look clean with the code being very easy to read,
			however, the excess of div elements could make it a little confusing when first looking at it.
