		<h3>File Management/Naming: </h3>
		<p>
			File management looks great on this page with no spaces contained within the files and folder
			names and all of the files being allocated to dedicated folders correctly such as css files
			in a styles folder. The html pages are found in the root of the folder of the project and 
			other files are exactly where they need to be. The primary stylesheet is found within the 
			the styles folder with the correct name of default.css. 
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Styles: </h3>
		<p>
			The page has styles applied to it with there being plenty of unique text and image styling 
			elements included allowing for a very interesting, but defined webpage. There is a default.css 
			file included on the page with a semi-neat format with the only issue being inconsistent curly 
			braces creating a little confusion when attempting to read it. Other than that, the spacing/styling 
			seems consistent throughout the entire file creating a pretty solid product. 
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Page Design: </h3>
		<p>
			This project has a great sense of style with no blacklisted fonts inlcuded and no styling decisions
			that goes against the guidelines. Everything on the site makes sense with links instead of being 
			blue/underlined are bolded so they fit the theme a little more which shows a case of a smaller 
			change making a big difference on the site. This being said the page fails in a couple of smaller 
			aspects such each page having a unqiue title with all of them having a generic "Queen City Planners" name.
			Another instance of this is the heading sometimes having a title of the page while others don't which
			I don't find to be a huge issue but it exists. The footer is rather simplistic with the inclusion of
			a designer tag (for example Designed by JJ Smithy Enterprises (c)2020), however there was no validation 
			for both html and css which is essential. Although I like a lot of the design elements on the site, I 
			think that it is missing some consistency in terms of design. More specifcially the nav coloring is a bit 
			odd (the active color) on top of some of the text being quite difficult to read without a highlight. The 
			use of default buttons on the contact us page could also be addressed.  
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>Validation: </h3>
		<p>
			The page does not include any validation buttons so I'll just leave the requirements from the master doc:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Do the buttons have transparency behind the checkboxes?</li>
			<li>There should be no small underline between the buttons (hint: text-decoration: none on the anchor tag will remove that)</li>
			<li>When I hover over the buttons do they lead to a link that ends with referrer? If not, check your links as they are meant to submit the page they came from (the referring page) for validation, so the same link will work from any page.</li>
			<li>Do the pages validate fully with no warnings or errors?</li>
		</ul>
		<hr>
		<h3>Page Code:</h3>
		<p>
			Everything concerning page code looks clean to me with the inclusion of a header, main, and footer within the
			body and the indents look great. This is a minor complaint, however, I find the exclusion of the navbar 
			from the header to be a bit strange. It doesn't affect the page at all it makes sense for the header to contain
			the navbar since it's placed at the top.
