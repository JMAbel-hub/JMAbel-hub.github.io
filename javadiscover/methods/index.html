        <h3>Method Overview: </h3>
        <p>
            Methods are essentially a way of optimizing your code and increase readability. 
            Specifically, if you have a section of code that will be reused frequently, then 
            you will most likely want to write a method that does the operation and return a
            value back into your main method. There two primary types of methods, one that 
            returns a value and another that returns void or null. These methods are featured
            outside of the main method and should make your main method both more visually 
            appealing and more efficient. 
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            In the case of the code above we have two methods (paramMethod and noParamMethod) on top
            of main. In paramMethod we take in two parameters that we assign as x and y that we add 
            together and eventually print out to the console. When we reference this method we have to
            already have two integers already initialized so we can plug it into the method. Note that 
            since the method has the returnType void meaning there cannot be return statement within the 
            method. Next we can look at noParamMethod which has no parameters so the method can simply be 
            ran with not parameters included. In this case we create two integers and add them together
            and since the returnType is an int, the method will return the product integer to the main method. 
        </p>

        <h3>Activity: </h3>
        <p>
            For The activity in Stage 4, you will either continue on your activity from Stage 3 or create 
            a new calculator that implements methods. More specifically, create a couple methods to perform
            math functions such as absolute value, minimum, maximum, and power as well as integrate them
            into a functional calculator. Effective use of methods is a game changer in Java and is 
            something that all programmers should have knowledge of.
