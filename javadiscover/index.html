        <h3>Overview: </h3>
        <p>
            Welcome to Java Discover! Where we will be aiding your learning process of Java by providing 
            a step-by-step process on how to get to object-oreinted programming. This will be done through
            several stages designed to highlight important information as well as provide some fun 
            activities to complete in order to test your knowledge. In this course you will be exposed to 
            fundamental programming concepts, including object-oriented programming while also learning 
            smaller concepts along the way! Each stage is pretty simplistic, providing a unique and fun 
            way to learn the fundamental concepts of Java. 
        </p>
        <h3>Disclaimer: </h3>
        <p>
            This program is intended to aid in the learning process of Java and should not take the place 
            of an actual program intened to teach you java. The program includes a broad overveiw of each
            basic concept to get you started in object-oriented programming, providing you supplementary 
            information alongside a proven method to learn Java. This program also serves as a great 
            refresher for those who haven't programmed in Java in a while and need something to help 
            them to pick up where they left off.
