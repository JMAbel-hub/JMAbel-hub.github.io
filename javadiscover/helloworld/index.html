        <h2>Hello World!</h2>  
        <h3 class="subtitle">Learn the very basics and core concepts of Java.</h3>
        <hr>
        <h3>Print Line: </h3>
        <p>
            To start off, we should learn how to print to the console. To do this is quite simple 
            with the phrase: System.out.println(); which allows any content within the parentheses
            to be printed within the console. More specifically, System is a class from the core 
            library provided by Java, out is an object that controls the output, and println() is 
            a method with a single parameter. Currently, you shouldn't worry about the complexities
            of the function, just know that it is how you print information. An example can be found
            below with the classic "Hello World" program:
        </p>
        <figure class="center">
            <a href="images/hello_world.png">
                <img src = "images/hello_world.png" alt="hello world example">
            </a>
            <figcaption>Hello World!</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <hr>
        <h3>Commenting: </h3>
        <p>
            You may have noticed have noticed the green text with the two slashes in the "Hello World"
            program and these are commonly referred to as comments. Comments are instances of text 
            that will be ignored by the compiler to increase readability of a program. There are 
            two notable methods of commenting with a single line comment being indicated by a //
            and a multi-line comment starting with /* and ending with */. It is very important
            for a student to start building early habits of commenting their code to make it 
            easier for others to comprehend their thought process as well as the code itself.
        </p>

        <h3>Classes/main() Method:</h3>
        <p>
            Now that we've established some basic concepts to get you started, we now need a place to
            house our code and allow our programs to compile. Every Java program must have one class 
            whose name is the same as the program filename and every application must contain a main()
            method which is conisdered the entry point. The signature of the method is public static 
            void main(String[] args) { } where you write your code in between the curly braces as seen
            in the example below with a file named javaTester:
        </p>

                <img src = "images/class.png" alt="class and main() example">
            </a>
            <figcaption>Example of a program to print a statement</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <hr>
        <h3>Other Important Knowledge:</h3>
        <p>
            In Java whitespace is completely ignored, with things such as spaces and new lines between
            statements being completely ignored. This being said statements are lines of code that execute
            a task and are eventually terminated with a ; which should end every statement line. 
        </p>

        <h3>Activity:</h3>
        <p> 
            Write a program that exemplifies everything you learned in stage 1 by creating a class by the
            name of stageOne that contains a main method and prints two seperated statements. Remember
            to leave comments in order to maintain your thought process as well as build healthy 
            coding habits. A successful program should compile with no errors and print two statements
            of your choice. 
        </p>
