        <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>  
        <h3 class="subtitle">Learn about object creation in Java and how to apply them.</h3>
        <hr id="range">
        <h3>Classes and Objects: </h3>
        <p>
            Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming. The 
            whole concept of object-oriented programming revolves around creating objects 
            of a certain class. For example if you had a class named Fruit you would have 
            objects such as Apple, Banana, Mango which are created off of the blueprint 
            of Fruit. To do this an entirely new class dedicated to making objects with 
            the object having unique features such as size, name, age that make each 
            object completely unique. In this example we are going to create a person class
            with a unique age, height (in cm), and name. 
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Constructors: </h3>
        <p>
            To get started we should create a constrcutor which is a method dedicated to 
            initializing objects which is called when an object of a class needs to be 
            created. There can be multiple types of constructors with them having varying
            numbers of parameters providing different results when implemented. In the 
            example below we will show both a default constructor and a constructor with 
            full parameters as well as how to create objects in main. When creating a 
            object class, you should create at least a default constructor to start the 
            creation of objects. 
        </p>

            <figcaption>Example of a default and full constructor</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <hr>
        <h3>Setters: </h3>
        <p>
            After creating the constructor, you might wonder if there was a way to change
            the variables of an object within your main method. As it turns out, there is
            throuhg the usage of setters (also referred to as mutators) which simply 
            replaces a value in an object with another one. When creating an object class,
            for every global variable contained in the object there should be a setter 
            corresponding to each one.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <hr>
        <h3>Getters: </h3>
        <p>
            Now that we've figured out the basics of constructor and setter creation, you might 
            ask how we access this data or retrieve it in the main method or elsewhere. This is 
            done through getters (also referred to as accessors) which is written as a pretty 
            simple method returning the value of whatever you're trying to get. Simialrly to 
            setters, getters should also be written into the object class corresponding to 
            each variable contained within the object. 
        </p>

        <h3>Put it All Together/Activity: </h3>
        <p>
            Now that we've established the very basics of object creation, we want you to put 
            it all together in the final activity! Create a program to simulate a bank 
            situation where we can create account objects that have a name, balance, and 
            id. Since we've left data storage out of this curriculum do not worry about account
            creation, however, if you are interested do some research to storing objects in an 
            array and challenge yourself by allowing account creation.
